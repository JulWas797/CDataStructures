# C Data Structures
Implementation of various data structures (Stack, Link list, etc) in C language.

Feel free to use my implementations if you want. 

**Currently they serve as a demonstration, and as a little "playground" for me to turn raw C knowledge into work.**
I plan to release some better and more practical projects when I learn Win32API.
